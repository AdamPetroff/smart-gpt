World War II began on September 1, 1939, following years of rising tension marked by the Treaty of Versailles' repercussions and the rise of fascism in Europe. Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland, triggering declarations of war by Britain and France. Over the next few years, Germany rapidly conquered much of Europe, including France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Norway, driven by Hitler's desire for Lebensraum (living space). In 1941, Germany launched a comprehensive attack on the Soviet Union, breaking their non-aggression pact and marking a significant escalation in the conflict. Meanwhile, Japan, seeking to expand its empire in the Pacific, launched a surprise attack on the United States' naval base at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, leading to America's entry into the war. The war became truly global as the Allied powers, including the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and other nations, fought against the Axis powers, primarily Germany, Italy, and Japan. The Holocaust, a systematic genocide of six million Jews and millions of others, was carried out by Nazi Germany during this time, representing one of history's darkest periods. Major battles and campaigns, such as the Battle of Stalingrad, the Battle of Normandy (D-Day), and the Battle of Midway, were crucial in shaping the war's outcome. World War II finally came to an end on September 2, 1945, when Japan surrendered after the United States dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
